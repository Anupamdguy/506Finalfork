# Description of the Project

The project aims to analyze animal-related complaints submitted through Boston’s 311 app. The analysis will focus on identifying trends in complaint volumes, types of animals involved, geographic patterns, and seasonal variations. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the Citywide Analytics Team for improving city operations and addressing the concerns strategically.

# Clear Goals
Analyze the total number of animal complaints over the past 2, 5, and 10 years to identify trends (e.g., increasing or decreasing).
Categorize complaints by animal type (e.g., rats, dogs, cats) to determine which animals are most commonly reported.
Map geographic hotspots for complaints and explore correlations between complaint types and locations.
Examine how seasonal factors (e.g., weather or time of year) influence complaint volumes and types.

# Data Collection
# Data Source:
The primary dataset will be the "311 Service Requests" dataset from Boston’s Analyze Boston platform, along with its accompanying data dictionary.
# Collection Method:
Download historical datasets from Analyze Boston's open data portal.
If necessary, integrate weather data from publicly available sources (e.g., NOAA or Weather Underground) to study seasonal impacts.
# Data Fields Needed:
Date and time of complaint submission.
Complaint type/category.
Description of the issue.
Geographic location (latitude/longitude or neighborhood).
Weather conditions (if integrated).

# Data Modeling Plan
# Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing complaint categories.
Geocode addresses if latitude/longitude is missing.
# Modeling Techniques:
Clustering: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group complaints based on geographic locations.
Trend Analysis: Apply time-series models to detect patterns in complaint volumes over different time periods.
Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between complaint types, seasons, and geographic areas using statistical methods.
Predictive Models (Extensions): Use decision trees or XGBoost to predict future complaint volumes based on historical trends and external factors like weather.

# Data Visualization Plan
Heatmap: Visualize geographic hotspots for animal complaints using tools like ArcGIS or Power BI.
Time-Series Graphs: Show trends in complaint volumes over time (monthly/yearly).
Bar Charts: Highlight the distribution of complaints by animal type.
Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between seasonal factors (e.g., temperature) and complaint volumes.
Interactive Dashboards: Build a Power BI dashboard for stakeholders to explore data dynamically.

# Test Plan
Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
Use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
Temporal Validation:
Train models on data from earlier years (e.g., 2015–2020) and test on more recent years (e.g., 2021–2024).
Performance Metrics:
Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like RMSE for predictive models or silhouette scores for clustering.

# Final Deliverables
Cleaned datasets and all code uploaded to a designated platform with a detailed README file.
A comprehensive final report covering:
Key findings and insights from the analysis.
Methodology used for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
A presentation summarizing key insights with visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and dashboards.
